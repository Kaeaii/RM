        "abstract": "With the advent of artificial intelligence and proliferation in the demand for an online dialogue system, the popularity of chatbots is growing on various industrial platforms. eir applications are getting widely noticed with intelligent tools as they are able to mimic human behavior in natural languages. Chatbots have been proven successful for many languages, such as English, Spanish, and French, over the years in varied fields like entertainment, medicine, education, and commerce. However, Arabic chatbots are challenging and are scarce, especially in the maintenance domain. erefore, this research proposes a novel framework for an Arabic troubleshooting chatbot aiming at diagnosing and solving technical issues. e framework addresses the difficulty of using the Arabic language and the shortage of Arabic chatbot content. is research presents a realistic implementation of creating an Arabic corpus for the chatbot using the developed framework. e corpus is developed by extracting IT problems/solutions from multiple domains and reliable sources. e implementation is carried forward towards solving specific technical solutions from customer support websites taken from different well-known organizations such as Samsung, HP, and Microsoft. e claims are proved by evaluating and conducting experiments on the dataset by comparing with the previous researches done in this field using different metrics. Further, the validations are well presented by the proposed system that outperforms the previously developed different types of chatbots in terms of several parameters such as accuracy, response time, dataset data, and solutions given as per the user input.",

        "abstract": "Chatbots have attracted the interest of many entities within the public and private sectors locally within Saudi Arabia and also globally. Chatbots have many implementations in the education field and can range from enhancing the e-learning experience to answer students' inquiries about course schedules and grades, tracking prerequisites information and elective courses. This work aim is to develop a chatbot engine that helps with frequently asked questions about the Blackboard system, which could be embedded into the Blackboard website. It contains a machine-learning model trained on Arabic datasets. The engine accepts both Arabic textual content as well as English textual content if needed; for commonly used English terminologies. Rasa framework was chosen as the main tool for developing the Blackboard chatbot. The dataset to serve the current need (ie Blackboard system) was requested from Blackboard support staff to build the initial dataset and get a sense of the frequently asked questions by KSU Blackboard student users. The dataset is designed to account for as many as possible of KSU Blackboard related inquires to provide the appropriate answers and reduce the workload of Blackboard system support staff. Testing and evaluating the model was a continuous process before and after the model deployment. The model post-tuning metrics were 93.4%, 92.5%, 92.49% for test accuracy, f1-score and precision, respectively. The average reported accuracy in similar studies were near 90% on average as opposed to results reported here.",

        "abstract": "To emulate the interactivity of in-person math instruction, we developed MathBot, a rule-based chatbot that explains math concepts, provides practice questions, and offers tailored feedback. We evaluated MathBot through three Amazon Mechanical Turk studies in which participants learned about arithmetic sequences. In the first study, we found that more than 40% of our participants indicated a preference for learning with MathBot over videos and written tutorials from Khan Academy. The second study measured learning gains, and found that MathBot produced comparable gains to Khan Academy videos and tutorials. We solicited feedback from users in those two studies to emulate a real-world development cycle, with some users finding the lesson too slow and others finding it too fast. We addressed these concerns in the third and main study by integrating a contextual bandit algorithm into MathBot to personalize the pace of the conversation, allowing the bandit to either insert extra practice problems or skip explanations. We randomized participants between two conditions in which actions were chosen uniformly at random (i.e., a randomized A/B experiment) or by the contextual bandit. We found that the bandit learned a similarly effective pedagogical policy to that learned by the randomized A/B experiment while incurring a lower cost of experimentation. Our findings suggest that personalized conversational agents are promising tools to complement existing online resources for math education, and that data-driven approaches such as contextual bandits are valuable tools for learning effective personalization.",

        "abstract": "Chatbots actively help the human user through digital conversation through NLP based on artificial intelligence (AI). It can be pre-trained to understand the user's queries and produce an immediate response in NLP. The user input of the chatbot is any format like voice, text, sentiments, etc. Many research works have been implemented. The issues of existing works are that during the digital conversation, it does not accurately identify the user's requirement, it may go irrelevant to the user's query, and also, primarily, it is voice-based and faces hitches in the analysis of the user's intention, unable to track the context in long-conversation. Therefore, for understanding the context, sentimental calculations are essential. This paper proposed to make the immediate response of users in the chatbot by using Bi-directional Recurrent Neural Network with a Fuzzy Na\u00efve Bayes classifier (BRNN-FNB). This paper aims to build chatbot models with AI-based sentimental analysis, which helps humans to perform accurate interactions. The working concept of chatbots is based on two forms of artificial intelligence domains: machine learning and natural language processing. It may be used in many applications like digital marketing, education, and online forums. The accuracy rate of the proposed work BRNN-FNB got 93% using the Seq-to-Seq technique. And also, the accuracy rate of the proposed work BRNN-FNB without using Seq-to-Seq got 92%.",

        "abstract": "What factors drive consumers to use artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots? The current study examined the associations among AI-powered chatbots\u2019 anthropomorphism (human-likeness, animacy, and intelligence), social presence, imagery processing, psychological ownership, and continuance intention in the context of Human-AI-Interaction. Results from a path analysis using LISREL 8.54 show that consumers\u2019 perceived human-likeness of AI-powered chatbots is a positive predictor of social presence and imagery processing. Imagery processing is a positive predictor of psychological ownership of the products (fashion industry) and services (tourism industry) promoted by the chatbots. Most importantly, social presence and imagery processing are positive predictors of AI-chatbot continuance intention. These empirical findings entail practical implications for AI-powered chatbot developers and managerial implications for commercial brands such that (1) increasing anthropomorphism of chatbots and inducing the sense of being co-present with the chatbots are important factors AI-chatbot designers and developers need to consider and (2) inducing vivid visualization of the products endorsed by the chatbots is an important variable marketers need to understand.",

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a conceptual remodel of Information Retrieval (IR) chatbot framework designed to eliminate the need for large Question-Answer (QA) pair dataset in chatbot's machine learning training and knowledge base development. Within ten proposed framework's components, we describe Ans2Q: a Neural Network model for question type approximation, and HR6: an IR score ranking calculation based on Ans2Q output. Fundamentally, these two components are the variance in which the proposed framework differs from others. Together with process flow explanation, we also provide several related formulas that hopefully can be used to implement this framework. Our general aim with this framework is to provide a tool that can be used to develop close domain chatbot with small knowledge and no readily available QA pair datasets.",

        "abstract": " This work serves as a review of our experience applying off-policy techniques to train and evaluate a contextual bandit model powering a troubleshooting notification in a chatbot. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of off-policy evaluation when data volume is orders of magnitude less than typically found in the literature. We present our reward function and choices behind its design, as well as how we construct our logging policy to balance exploration and performance on key metrics. Next, we present a guided framework to update a model post-training called Post-Hoc Reward Distribution Hacking, which we employed to improve model performance and correct deficiencies in trained models stemming from the existence of a null action and a noisy reward signal. Throughout the work, we include discussions of various practical pitfalls encountered while using off-policy methods in hopes to expedite other applications of these techniques.",

        "abstract": "Background: Behavioral eHealth and mobile health interventions have been moderately successful in increasing physical activity, although opportunities for further improvement remain to be discussed. Chatbots equipped with natural language processing can interact and engage with users and help continuously monitor physical activity by using data from wearable sensors and smartphones. However, a limited number of studies have evaluated the effectiveness of chatbot interventions on physical activity. Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility, usability, and effectiveness of a machine learning\u2013based physical activity chatbot. Methods: A quasi-experimental design without a control group was conducted with outcomes evaluated at baseline and 6 weeks. Participants wore a Fitbit Flex 1 (Fitbit LLC) and connected to the chatbot via the Messenger app. The chatbot provided daily updates on the physical activity level for self-monitoring, sent out daily motivational messages in relation to goal achievement, and automatically adjusted the daily goals based on physical activity levels in the last 7 days. When requested by the participants, the chatbot also provided sources of information on the benefits of physical activity, sent general motivational messages, and checked participants\u2019 activity history (ie, the step counts/min that were achieved on any day). Information about usability and acceptability was self-reported. The main outcomes were daily step counts recorded by the Fitbit and self-reported physical activity. Results: Among 116 participants, 95 (81.9%) were female, 85 (73.3%) were in a relationship, 101 (87.1%) were White, and 82 (70.7%) were full-time workers. Their average age was 49.1 (SD 9.3) years with an average BMI of 32.5 (SD 8.0) kg/m2. Most experienced technical issues were due to an unexpected change in Facebook policy (93/113, 82.3%). Most of the participants scored the usability of the chatbot (101/113, 89.4%) and the Fitbit (99/113, 87.6%) as at least \u201cOK.\u201d About one-third (40/113, 35.4%) would continue to use the chatbot in the future, and 53.1%(60/113) agreed that the chatbot helped them become more active. On average, 6.7 (SD 7.0) messages/week were sent to the chatbot and 5.1 (SD 7.4) min/day were spent using the chatbot. At follow-up, participants recorded more steps (increase of 627, 95% CI 219-1035 steps/day) and total physical activity (increase of 154.2 min/week; 3.58 times higher at follow-up; 95% CI 2.28-5.63). Participants were also more likely to meet the physical activity guidelines (odds ratio 6.37, 95% CI 3.31-12.27) at follow-up. Conclusions: The machine learning\u2013based physical activity chatbot was able to significantly increase participants\u2019 physical activity and was moderately accepted by the participants. However, the Facebook policy change undermined the chatbot functionality and indicated the need to use independent platforms for chatbot deployment to ensure successful delivery of this type of intervention.",

        "abstract": "Nowadays, museums are developing chatbots to assist their visitors and to provide an enhanced visiting experience. Most of these chatbots do not provide a human-like conversation and fail to deliver the complete requested knowledge by the visitors. There are plenty of stand-alone museum chatbots, developed using a chatbot platform, that provide predefined dialog routes. However, as chatbot platforms are evolving and AI technologies mature, new architectural approaches arise. Museums are already designing chatbots that are trained using machine learning techniques or chatbots connected to knowledge graphs, delivering more intelligent chatbots. This paper is surveying a representative set of developed museum chatbots and platforms for implementing them. More importantly, this paper presents the result of a systematic evaluation approach for evaluating both chatbots and platforms. Furthermore, the paper is introducing a novel approach in developing intelligent chatbots for museums. This approach emphasizes graph-based, distributed, and collaborative multi-chatbot conversational AI systems for museums. The paper accentuates the use of knowledge graphs as the key technology for potentially providing unlimited knowledge to chatbot users, satisfying conversational AI\u2019s need for rich machine-understandable content. In addition, the proposed architecture is designed to deliver an efficient deployment solution where knowledge can be distributed (distributed knowledge graphs) and shared among different chatbots that collaborate when is needed.",
